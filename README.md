# writeapaper

Copy of Davide's repository on how to write a paper. 

Every time I want to write a different paper, click on "use template" (top right corner) on this repository and create a new repository which we name after whatever the ongoing project is (e.g. PROJECT). The "draft" folder has the version which will be compiled each time, so we simply choose from one of the templates (in the template folder) and copy the files into the draft folder. Then, simply git clone on to our local machine and edit it in our favourite text editor - vscode. After all the changes are done, we add, commit and push. Everytime this is done, the git repository PROJECT will compile the draft. The pdf can be recovered if we go to the build branch of that repository
